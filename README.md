# codeup-web-exercises (ReHash)

The following is a post-graduate look at the Codeup curriculum to introduce unit testing and TDD (Test Driven Development).
This repo will begin with JavaScript I (Functions) /javascript-i/functions

## Getting Started

Through out the JavaSCript modules we will be using Jest, v23.6, and below are the instructions on how to setup

Open a terminal and `cd` into your current project folder unless your current working folder is already open.

```shell
> pwd
> cptcrunchy/wwwroot/codeup-web-exercises
```

( Its ok if none of this currently makes any sense. We will break down what is happening.)
Install Jest using `yarn`:

`yarn add -D jest`

OR using `npm`:

`npm install --save-dev jest`
